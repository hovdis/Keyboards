# Corne/helidox

Corne is a very small split, columinar keyboard that can have oled displays on top of the microcontrollers.

This project is one of the first more difficult builds I will do. It requires a lot of soldering, and since the soldering iron I have now is pretty big and bad, I need to either get a hold of another soldering iron, or use one from work.
