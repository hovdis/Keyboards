# BDN9 keyboard from keeb.io

BDN9 is a set you can buy from keeb.io [here](https://keeb.io/collections/frontpage/products/bdn9-3x3-9-key-macropad-rotary-encoder-support?variant=15959960944734)

It has support for up to two rotary encoders, which I wanted.

Unfortunately, I soldered on the Elite-C too far from the pcb, so the bottom plate do not have space. Therefore the build is not as good as I hoped. This is a pain to fix, since I need to desolder all pins on the Elite-C, and that takes a lot of time. Since it still functions perfectly, and it does not look that bad overall, I think i'm going to spare myself the hassle and just keep it as it is.
