# About
I am really into keybeards, especially switches and building keyboards from scratch.


# My keyboards
Rigt now, I have two daily drivers:

### Ergodox EZ
This keyboard is the keyboard I use at work, and the keyboard that really sparked my interest for keyboards, ahd espesially split and ortholinear ones.

When I boght the keyboard, they initially had cherry MX clear switches in it, but they were quickly swapped for Zeal Zilent v2 67g for the modifiers and 67g Zandas (Holy panda housing with Zilent stem)

More about this keyboard can be found [Here](ErgodoxEZ)


### Iris Rev 4
[tmp here](IrisRev4)
The keyboard I use at home is my newly made Iris Rev 4. 
Everything but keycaps and switches are from Keeb.io.
The keyboard has steel plates with an acryllic translusent middle-layer. 
The switches are Holy pandas, while the keycaps are just an assortment of different sets right now, since I am trying to learn the workman layout, and want legends for that.
