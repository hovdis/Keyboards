# About
I am really into keybeards, especially switches and building keyboards from scratch.


# My keyboards
Rigt now, I have two daily drivers:

### Ergodox EZ
This keyboard is the keyboard I use at work, and the keyboard that really sparked my interest for keyboards, ahd espesially split and ortholinear ones.

When I boght the keyboard, they initially had cherry MX clear switches in it, but they were quickly swapped for Zeal Zilent v2 67g for the modifiers and 67g Zandas (Holy panda housing with Zilent stem)

More about this keyboard can be found [Here](ErgodoxEZ)


### Iris Rev 4
[tmp here](IrisRev4)
The keyboard I use at home is my newly made Iris Rev 4. 
Everything but keycaps and switches are from Keeb.io.
The keyboard has steel plates with an acryllic translusent middle-layer. 
The switches are Holy pandas, while the keycaps are just an assortment of different sets right now, since I am trying to learn the workman layout, and want legends for that.

# Projects

### 2x4 Macroboard
''Insert pictures here''

This was my first dabble in making keyboards, and I am really happy with how it turned out.
I started by buying an Arduino pro micro, a soldering iron and some wire.
Since the plate I printed only had 8 slots for switches, and the pro micro had 8 data-pins, I could solder each switch to their own data-pin.
This helps with the complexity of the project a lot, since you dont need to think about matrix-soldering or any resistors.
I programmed the pro micro to send the signals F13, F14, ..., F20, since these buttons rarely have a use in an operating system, and they are natively accepted. That is perfect when you are setting macros, since you can just add that keypress to any shortcut, but you can also write an AHK(Auto Hot Key) script to do something else.

The code for the arduino and the AHK script I wrote will be added later [here](projects)


### 7x7 Switch tester

This was just a small project with just printing a plate that could hold multiple different switches which I could find out what switches I liked and not.
I ordered two of every different switch I could find on two different websites, and populated the switch tester.
This has seen more use than I anticipated, since people that have been introduced to this hobby after me has had a chance to both test different keyboard sizes (since I have many different types), but also figured out what switches they would like.

Pictures of the switch tester and the 3d-file will be poster [here](projects)
