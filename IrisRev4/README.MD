# Iris Rev 4

[Keymap](my_keymap.json)


## Build guide

This build is very easy, since all you have to do is solder on the switches to the pcb through the top-plate, then screw the bottom plate on with an optional middle layer.

Optionally, you can add per-switch leds, but since I don't use transparent keycaps, this is useless for me. Additionally, I don't want to be tied down to using only one color in lights.

# Specs

- Iris rev 4 pcb
- Carbon fiber top and bottom plates
- Invyr holy panda switches
- Generic PBT keycaps, cherry MX profile
- Generic planck cap-set from kbdfans, DSA profile to learn other keyboard layouts (workman)
